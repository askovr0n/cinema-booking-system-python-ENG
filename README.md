# Project 6: Cinema booking system

- The aim of the project was to create a website to enable the booking of cinema seats
- The website has two separate interfaces: one for logged-in customers and one for administrators
- Customers can browse the current repertoire, check the details of a selected film, book tickets including the choice of ticket type and modify their personal data
- Admins have the ability to make changes to the repertoire, have a view of all active customers including their purchases and can remove "ghost customers"
- The site infrastructure was written in Python using the Bottle library, which connects to a customer database created in SQL
